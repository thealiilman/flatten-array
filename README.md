# flatten-array
## Motivation behind this script
After reading [this article on Intercom's blog](https://www.intercom.com/blog/how-we-hire-engineers-part-1/), I thought, let's write a short Ruby script
that flattens an array!

## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:thealiilman/flatten-array.git
cd flatten-array

bundle install
pry -r ./flatten_array_service.rb
```
